# Attack of the Smartphone Zombies!

---

## Overview

In this era of rapid technological change, people walking on the road can see a cell phone everywhere, and these people are often walking while staring at their cell phones rickety like zombies, so these people are called " Smartphone Zombie ".

--

While these acts of zombies have endangered the surroundings and their own security, many countries (governments) have begun to attach importance to such issues.

Some governments have adopted a penalty system and some have set up such groups of zombies to prevent the zombies from causing them.  But even with so many measures still can not completely prevent the occurrence of danger.  Only people's own self-control ability to get rid of this point.

## Reflection

--

While the advancing technology, our life has become more convenient. And among these technological products, smartphone is the most influential thing in our life. We can use it to call anyone right away, to search the information we need immediately ,or to play the games . We may think that what a fantastic invention it is.

--

However, more and more people are addicted to using it, even while they’re crossing the street. It is very dangerous to use your smartphone while walking. Luckily, the governments have noticed this and think of some ways to solve it. I’ve seen many signs which remind us that no using the smartphones while crossing the road in Taichung recently. 

--

I think maybe some people will notice those signs, but they may not stop using it. The best way I think of to prevent the phubbers, who are always looking at their smartphones, is to shut down the Internet.
